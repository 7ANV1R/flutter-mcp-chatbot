# MCP Flutter Chatbot - Project Overview

## What is This Project?

This is a **weather chatbot mobile app** built with Flutter that demonstrates how to integrate modern AI technologies:

- ü§ñ **AI Chat**: Uses Google's Gemini AI to understand natural language
- üå¶Ô∏è **Real Weather**: Gets live weather data from OpenWeatherMap
- üì± **Mobile App**: Beautiful Flutter interface that works on iOS and Android
- üîß **Smart Tools**: AI automatically knows when to check weather based on your questions

## What Makes This Special?

### 1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

This app uses MCP - a new standard that lets AI assistants use external tools safely and efficiently. Think of it as a way for AI to "call functions" to get real data.

### 2. **Real AI Integration**

Instead of hardcoded responses, the app uses Google's Gemini AI to:

- Understand what you're asking
- Decide if it needs weather data
- Generate natural, conversational responses

### 3. **Live Data**

The weather information is real-time data from OpenWeatherMap, not fake demo data.

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. **You type**: "What's the weather like in Tokyo?"
2. **AI thinks**: "They want weather info for Tokyo, I need to use my weather tool"
3. **App fetches**: Real weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
4. **AI responds**: "It's currently 22¬∞C and sunny in Tokyo with light winds..."

## Key Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For the mobile app interface with Material Design 3
- **Dart**: Programming language with clean architecture principles
- **Google Gemini AI**: For natural language understanding
